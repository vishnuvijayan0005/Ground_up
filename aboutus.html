                    To oversimplify, Top down processing sounds like “research suggests 8 glasses of water a day are important” bottom up
                    processing sounds like “I feel thirsty, I am going to get a glass of water” The latter is the expression of an
                    internally lived and organismic regulated truth, these kinds of truths match the phenomenological truths which emerge in
                    Non ordinary states and is why bottom up processing is so important to support.
