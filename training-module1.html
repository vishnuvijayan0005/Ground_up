                    Bridging the Triad of Therapist, Client and Medicine

                <p>
                    Modile 1 supports therapist to guide clients deeply into their felt experience, both in
                    Psychotherapy and Non ordinary
                    experiences, as the pathway to deeper, more fundamental insights and subsequent change. <br> <br>

                    The scope of module 1 is primarily on the preparation and integration of clients engaging in
                    Psychedelic medicines.
                    <br> <br>
                    The macro learning outcome is the realigning of psychotherapeutic approach to match and support the
                    Characteristics of
                    the psychedelic experience; thus reorienting Mental Health practitioners from a top down (thinking)
                    orientation to a
                    bottom up (felt) orientation.
                    <br> <br>
                    In bridging the triad of Therapist Client and Medicine the learner will navigate 2 key directions
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Learning and applying psychotherapeutic skills, approaches, frameworks and lenses that support
                        clients to engage via a
                        bottom up, feeling orientation whilst staying in direct relationship with their own experience
                        and the therapist.</li>
                    <li> To support the therapist themselves to become more Felt lead, Bottom up and in relationship
                        with themselves and their
                        clients.</li>

                    Aligning approach to medicine powerfully supports clients to better assimilate their non ordinary
                    experiences into
                    integrated wholes at the cognitive, somatic relational and spiritual level.
                    <br><br>
                    Being problem focused, cognitive, analytical and “client lead” are important and useful approaches
                    in conventional
                    Psychotherapy, although these largely Top-down approaches are insufficient when guiding clients
                    through many or most
                    forms of Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy.
